          <h2>First computer programmer</h2>
          <p>Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace (née Byron; 10 December 1815 – 27 November 1852) was an English mathematician and writer, chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's
             proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. She was the first to recognise
             that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation, and to have published the first algorithm intended to be carried out by such a machine. As a result, she is often regarded as the first computer programmer.</p>
          <p>Ada Lovelace's notes were labelled alphabetically from A to G. In note G, she describes an algorithm for the Analytical Engine to compute Bernoulli numbers. It is considered to be the first published algorithm ever specifically
             tailored for implementation on a computer, and Ada Lovelace has often been cited as the first computer programmer for this reason.[73][74] The engine was never completed and so her program was never tested.[75]
          </p>
          <p>In  1953, more than a century after her death, Ada Lovelace's notes on Babbage's Analytical Engine were republished as an appendix to B. V. Bowden's Faster than Thought: A Symposium on Digital Computing Machines.[76] The engine has now been recognised
          as an early model for a computer and her notes as a description of a computer and software.</p>
